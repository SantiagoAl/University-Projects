1. Probably want to use a hashSet for this assignment
2. Should probably multiply the sizeof the array list by 8 to make sure that the
   hashSet never has to expand itself, thus evading the O(n^2) runtime
3. Look into the "Point" class in java, it may help. But I definitely want to
   make sure it is not going to wreck my runtime
